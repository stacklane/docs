        <div class="alert alert-info small" role="alert">
            Changing and refactoring role names is a <i>safe</i> operation,
            as long as you also update any code references to them.
            Role names are not associated with data.
        </div>

        <p>
            Roles contain 1 or more permission rules.
            Permission rules define what is allowed for a role.
            Most commonly permission rules map to model data operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scripts and templates code against role names.
            In other words:  "Is role ABC active for the current user/session".
            The permission rules that a role contains consists
            of two parts: 1) Resource Rule, 2) Operation(s) Allowed
        </p>

        <pre class="language-yaml"><code>
roles:
  [ROLE_NAME]:
    [RESOURCE_RULE]: [OPERATIONS_ALLOWED]
    </code></pre>

        <h6>Resource Rule</h6>
        <p>
            Resource rules for models simply follow the data structure, from general to specific.
        </p>

        <pre class="language-yaml"><code>
ðŸ“¦
ðŸ“¦.Task
ðŸ“¦.Task.name
    </code></pre>

        <h6>Operation Names</h6>
        <p>
            The available permission operations are:
            <code>all</code>,
            <code>create</code>
            <code>read</code>,
            <code>update</code>,
            <code>delete</code>,
            <code>state</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Most operations map directly to an HTTP method.
            For predictable handling of endpoints that need to be role-constrained,
            we recommend following this general pattern.
        </p>

        <table class="table">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Operation</th>
            <th scope="col">Description</th>
            <th scope="col">HTTP</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>

        <tr>
            <td><code>read</code></td>
            <td>
                Read operations are allowed.
                <br>
                <small>Depending on the case "read" may also refer to "get", "load", "accessible", or "visible".</small>
            </td>
            <td><b>GET</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>update</code></td>
            <td>
                Update operations are allowed.
                <br>
                <small>May also refer to "editing" or "modifying" something that already exists.</small>
            </td>
            <td><b>PUT</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>delete</code></td>
            <td>Delete operations are allowed.
                <br>
                <small>May also refer to quasi-deletes, such as an operation that could be rolled back.</small>
            </td>
            <td><b>DELETE</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>state</code></td>
            <td>State change operations are allowed.
                <br>
                <small>
                This is a special case of "update", where a significant "state change" is also taking place.
                A state change usually involves concepts regarding "status", "publish", or "lifecycle"
                    -- typically auditing or event logging takes place as well.
                </small>
            </td>
            <td><b>PATCH</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>list</code></td>
            <td>
                List operations are allowed.
                <br>
                <small>List operations are "bulk" operations, and may refer to queries, or
                anything that returns or operates on <i>potentially</i> multiple results.
                </small>
            </td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

        <h6>Full Role Example</h6>
        <p>
        <pre class="language-yaml"><code>
roles:
  admin:
    ðŸ“¦: all
  task-editor:
    ðŸ“¦.Task: create,read,update,list
    </code></pre>
        </p>

        <h6>Naming Recommendations</h6>
        <p>
            We recommend using a singular form for role names.
            This will help to clearly
            distinguish role names from the plural form recommended for group names.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><code><a name="groups">groups</a></code></h2>

        <div class="alert alert-warning small" role="alert">
            Unlike role names, group names are <i>not</i> freely changeable,
            especially if they have been used and associated with existing users.
        </div>

        <p>
            Groups contain 1 or more named <code>roles</code>.
            Users are assigned to groups.
            Scripts and templates are <i>unaware</i> of groups --
            they are only aware of the roles activated by groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember, groups are associated with all of your user data.
            Freely change and refactor your role names (and the code that uses them, of course),
            but remember that changing in-use group names will
            alter access for users associated with those groups.
            In short: changing group names is not recommended.
        </p>

        <h6>Full Group Example</h6>
        <p>
            Beneath the name of group, list out the roles it contains.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-yaml"><code>
groups:
  administrators:
    - admin
  editors:
    - task-editor
    </code></pre>

        <h6>Naming Recommendations</h6>
        <p>
            As groups represent a collection of many users,
            we recommend using the plural form of group names.
            This will also more clearly
            distinguish group names from the singular form recommended for role names.
