title: JavaScript Endpoints

summary: Learn how to use JavaScript to create custom logic for your views and endpoints.
---

Stacklane uses a JavaScript subset for server-side logic.
This subset is designed for speed, security, and compile time validation.

In many cases JavaScript endpoints are used in conjunction with JavaScript
[Suppliers](/🗄/Article/scripting/suppliers.md).
Suppliers allow for code reuse between multiple endpoints, creating simpler endpoint code.

Scripts are executed on the server-side only, and their last emitted value
becomes the response value. Scripts never produce HTML, which is better suited
for [Mustache](/🗄/Article/endpoints/mustache.md) files.

# Routing

The file name is used to determine both the endpoint path and the HTTP verb it responds to.
There are several ways of defining JavaScript endpoints, and it's a matter of preference
which to choose.  There is no functional difference.
Note that in all cases JavaScript endpoints do not end in a trailing "/".

## Verb Name Only

Place an uppercase verb name in a directory.
`GET.js`, `POST.js`, `PUT.js`, `DELETE.js`.

For example `/hello/POST.js` responds to requests for `POST /hello`.

Or for a [dynamic path](/🗄/Article/endpoints/dynamic.md) such as `/product/{product}/GET.js`,
a corresponding request could be `/product/1234`.

## Index / Directory

JavaScript endpoints by default do not respond to directory requests ending in "/".
In certain cases directory requests are useful,
especially if the JS endpoint is redirecting to other endpoints.
In this case use `🖥index.js`, such as `/here/🖥index.js`
to have the endpoint respond at `GET /here/`.

## Emoji and Name

Verbs are represented by a specific an emoji prefix.

- 🖥 - GET
- 📮 - POST
- ❌ - DELETE

The rest of the name after verb prefix becomes the endpoint name.
For example a file name of
`/account/{account}/🖥settings.js`
responds to requests for `GET /account/1234/settings`.

# Redirects

## Internal Redirects

Output a [redirect object](/🗄/Article/scripting/helpers.md#redirect).
    
# JSON Output {#json}

Output an object literal from the script to create a JSON response.  For example:

```javascript
({
  hello: 'world'
});
```

Result:

```javascript
{
  "hello": "world"
}
```

Stream aware model methods may also be used:

```javascript
/* Code to assign LoadedList variable */

({
  list: LoadedList.name,
  tasks: LoadedList(()=>Task.all().map(t=>({name:t.title}}))
});
```

Result:

```javascript
{
  "list": "hello"
  "tasks": [{"name":"world"}]
}
```

# Click Actions {#get-action}

GET's are generally designed to be side effect free, and only for retrieving information.
There are certain cases when coming from an external site, or link in an email,
where it may be useful to update models or write cookies.

If this case is needed use the mouse prefix "🖱" to designate the special GET endpoint to respond to such requests:

```file-name
/🖱verify.js
```
```javascript
import {Verify} from '📦';
import {Cookie} from '🍪';
import {t} from '&';

try {
  Verify.token(t).get().verified = true;
  new Cookie().name('verified').value(t).days(30);
  Redirect.dir('verified');
} catch ($ModelNotFound){
  Redirect.dir('unverified');
}
```

Click actions are a narrow case, and there are few limitations to be aware of:

- [Redirect](/🗄/Article/scripting/helpers.md#redirect)'s are the only valid response.
- [Suppliers](/🗄/Article/scripting/suppliers.md) are not supported.
- Models may be updated, but not created or deleted.

# Configuration

Adding a file with the same name as the JavaScript endpoint, but with 
the extension `yaml` will create a configuration file specific to the endpoint.
For example, a configuration file for the POST `📮setup.js` would be `📮setup.yaml` in the same directory.

The primary use of this file is to define 
[endpoint-specific role behavior](/🗄/Article/users/roles.md#endpoint).
