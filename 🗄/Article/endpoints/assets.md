summary: Learn how to use images, SCSS, and client-side JavaScript.

# Images {#images}

Static images are used and referenced from HTML as normal.
Stacklane will automatically replace all image references with a unique hash identifier,
to facilitate long-term access from a Content Delivery Network.

## Permanent Image URLs

In certain cases, such as images distributed through social media,
it may be desirable to keep a permanent image URL regardless of any future changes to the image.
Simply prefix the image's name with ðŸ“Œ.
For example, the internal image file `/assets/social/ðŸ“Œlogo.png`
will resolve externally at the path `/assets/social/logo.png`.
Within any HTML source the internal file path should be used:

```html
<meta name="og:image" href="/assets/social/ðŸ“Œlogo.png">
```

# SCSS {#scss}

Stacklane includes native support for `.scss` files.
For a SCSS file at `/theme.scss`, reference this
in your HTML or Mustache file as you would any CSS file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme.scss" ... >
```

We recommend using SCSS over plain CSS as it inherently supports
combining many files into one, as well as minification.

If the SCSS file is a [private file](/ðŸ—„/Article/endpoints/mustache.md#private-files),
then it will be inlined into the HTML.

# CSS

A `.css` file may be included anywhere, however in general we recommend SCSS (`.scss`) files
due to the additional capabilities offered.
There are performance benefits to SCSS in addition to its functionality --
SCSS inherently supports combining many files into one, as well as minification.

# JS {#js}

Whenever possible consider using native
[DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)
methods and of course [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/).
Web development has come a long way, and certain monolithic libraries were
created in the day of poor cross-browser compatibility.

## Inlining

Provided any major functionality has been brought in via a third party JS library,
in some cases it may make sense to simply inline your JavaScript.

Inline in the normal way using `<script>...</script>`.
Alternatively you may inline a private file by
referencing it like any external script: `<script src="/_myCode.js"></script>`.
Because of the underscore marking it as a private file, Stacklane inlines the JS into the page.

In either case Stacklane produces an appropriate Content Security Policy.

# HTML

If the extra capabilities of [Mustache](/ðŸ—„/Article/endpoints/mustache.md)
templates are not needed, then a plain HTML file may be used.  It follows the same routing conventions
and Content Security Policy requirements as Mustache files,
including putting `index.html` into a route with a trailing slash.
If you decide to rename your file extension to use Mustache in the future,
there is no change to the public endpoint/URL.

# Additional CSP {#add-csp}

Local or external JavaScript may have further dependencies -- for example it may connect to another API.

In that case it may be necessary to specify additional Content-Security-Policy information.
frame-src, script-src, connect-src, style-src, and font-src may be specified directly on the `<script>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.asset.com/file.js"
        data-frame-src="https://frame.asset.com/"
        data-connect-src="https://connect.asset.com/"
        data-style-src="https://style.asset.com/"
        data-font-src="https://font.asset.com/"
        data-script-src="https://script.asset.com/"></script>
```

# External JS/CSS {#external}

## JS

There are many excellent JS hosting services, where third party libraries are dependable, distributed, and versioned.

We like to think of third party JS libraries as part of the browser's stack
-- something that extends the native functionality of the browser, and that your app may put to use.

Ensure that you're able to obtain a reliable Subresource Integrity (SRI) `integrity` attribute for the external JS,
and place it on the `<script>` element.  Typically SRI is only reliable for versioned URLs.

## CSS

Ensure that you're able to obtain a reliable Subresource Integrity (SRI) `integrity` attribute for the external CSS,
and place it on the `<link>` element.  Typically SRI is only reliable for versioned URLs.

## Fonts

Third party font providers often require special setup for the Content-Security-Policy.
Stacklane bundles this setup into specific third party connectors.
The list of available font connectors may be found in the
[Stacklane Registry](https://github.com/stacklane-registry?q=font).

## SRI

For security purposes most external (third party) JavaScript and CSS must specify an `integrity` attribute.
Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that 
files they fetch are delivered without unexpected manipulation.
It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched file must match.
Most services such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
automatically provide SRI information to copy/paste.
