# SASS/SCSS {#scss}

Stacklane includes native support for `.scss` files.
If you have a SCSS file at `/theme.scss`, then reference this
in your HTML or Mustache file as you would any CSS file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme.scss" ... >
```

We recommend using SCSS over plain CSS as it inherently supports
combining many files into one, as well as minification.

If the SCSS file is a [private file](/ðŸ—„/Article/endpoints/mustache.md#private-files),
then it will be inlined into the HTML.

# HTML

If you do not need the extra capabilities of [Mustache](/ðŸ—„/Article/endpoints/mustache.md)
templates, then a plain HTML file may be used.  It follows the same routing conventions
and [CSP](/ðŸ—„/Article/endpoints/mustache.md#csp) requirements as Mustache files,
including putting `index.html` into a route with a
trailing slash. Therefore if you decide to rename your file extension to use Mustache
in the future, there is no change to the public endpoint/URL.

# CSS

You can include a `.css` anywhere,
however in general we recommend SASS/SCSS (`.scss`) files
due to the additional capabilities offered.
There are performance benefits to SCSS in addition to its functionality --
SCSS inherently supports combining many files into one, as well
as minification.

# Third Party JS {#js}
   
We like to think of third party JS libraries as part of the browser's stack
-- something that extends the native functionality of the browser, and that your
app can put to use.

We generally do not recommend hosting these
along with your other Stacklane files,
as it brings no benefit.

There are many excellent content delivery networks these days, where
third party libraries are dependable, static, and versioned.

<a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsDelivr</a> is one such service.
        
# SRI        

For security purposes all third party (external) JavaScript and CSS must
specify an `integrity` attribute.
Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that
files they fetch are delivered without unexpected manipulation.
It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched file must match.

# Custom JS

Unless you're building Angular-style single page applications, then
we recommend keeping your client-side JavaScript to a minimum.
Whenever possible consider using native
<a target="_blank"  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element">DOM</a>
methods and <a target="_blank" href="http://vanilla-js.com/">VanillaJS</a>.
        
## Inlining

Provided any major functionality has been brought in via a third party JS library,
in many cases it may make sense to simply inline your JavaScript.

Inline in the normal way using `<script>...</script>`.
Alternatively you may inline a private file by
referencing it like any external script:
`<script src="/_myCode.js"></script>`.
Because of the underscore marking it as a private file,
Stacklane inlines the JS into the page.
        
In either case Stacklane produces an appropriate [CSP](/ðŸ—„/Article/infrastructure.md#csp).
