# SASS/SCSS {#scss}

Stacklane includes native support for `.scss` files.
If you have a SCSS file at `/theme.scss`, then reference this
in your HTML or Mustache file as you would any CSS file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme.scss" ... >
```

We recommend using SCSS over plain CSS as it inherently supports
combining many files into one, as well as minification.

If the SCSS file is a [private file](/ðŸ—„/Article/endpoints/mustache.md#private-files),
then it will be inlined into the HTML.

# HTML

If you do not need the extra capabilities of [Mustache](/ðŸ—„/Article/endpoints/mustache.md)
templates, then a plain HTML file may be used.  It follows the same routing conventions
and [CSP](/ðŸ—„/Article/endpoints/mustache.md#csp) requirements as Mustache files,
including putting `index.html` into a route with a
trailing slash. Therefore if you decide to rename your file extension to use Mustache
in the future, there is no change to the public endpoint/URL.

# CSS

You can include a `.css` anywhere,
however in general we recommend SASS/SCSS (`.scss`) files
due to the additional capabilities offered.
There are performance benefits to SCSS in addition to its functionality --
SCSS inherently supports combining many files into one, as well
as minification.

# Third Party JS {#js}
   
We like to think of third party JS libraries as part of the browser's stack
&mdash; something that extends the native functionality of the browser, and that your
app can put to use.

We generally do not recommend hosting these along with your other Stacklane files, as it brings no additional benefit.

There are many excellent services these days, where third party libraries are dependable, distributed, and versioned.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsDelivr</a> is one such service.
        
## SRI        

For security purposes all third party (external) JavaScript and CSS must specify an `integrity` attribute.
Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that 
files they fetch are delivered without unexpected manipulation.
It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched file must match.
Most services such as jsDelivr automatically provide SRI information to copy/paste.
        
# Custom JS

Whenever possible consider using native
<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element">DOM</a>
methods and of course <a target="_blank" href="http://vanilla-js.com/">VanillaJS</a>.
Web development has come a long way, and certain monolithic libraries were 
created in the day of poor cross-browser compatibility.
        
## Inlining

Provided any major functionality has been brought in via a third party JS library,
in some cases it may make sense to simply inline your JavaScript.

Inline in the normal way using `<script>...</script>`.
Alternatively you may inline a private file by
referencing it like any external script:
`<script src="/_myCode.js"></script>`.
Because of the underscore marking it as a private file,
Stacklane inlines the JS into the page.
        
In either case Stacklane produces an appropriate [CSP](/ðŸ—„/Article/infrastructure.md#csp).

## Turbolinks + StimulusJS

As an alternative to the traditional "single page application" which 
often uses a complex library with its own learning curve, 
we recommend the combo of 
<a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks" target="_blank">Turbolinks</a> 
and
<a href="https://stimulusjs.org" target="_blank">StimulusJS</a>.

Turbolinks makes page-to-page navigation faster, and
Stimulus allows you to declaratively inject/connect JavaScript to HTML.
Together they are a lightweight alternative 
which respects the natural structure of the web, allows 
code to stay close to the native browser capabilities,
and facilitates highly readable and maintainable code.
