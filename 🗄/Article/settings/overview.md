Stacklane only requires a single [manifest](/🗄/Article/settings/manifest.md)
configuration file, and it only needs to contain a single value (the name of the site or web app).
All other configuration files are used as-needed to enable additional case-specific functionality.

- [**Manifest 🎛.yaml** Defines the name and other basic properties. {.box}](/🗄/Article/settings/manifest.md)
- [**Properties 🎨.scss** Configurable colors, phrases, and variables. {.box}](/🗄/Article/settings/properties.md)
- [**Nested 🔌name.yaml** Nest a site at a sub-path of another site. {.box}](/🗄/Article/settings/nested.md)
- [**Users 👤.yaml** Configure user functionality per directory. {.box}](/🗄/Article/users/settings.md)
