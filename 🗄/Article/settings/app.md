Progressive web apps use modern web APIs along with traditional progressive enhancement 
strategy to create cross-platform web applications.
These apps work everywhere and provide several features that 
give them similar user experience advantages as native apps. 

# Manifest

To indicate support for PWA, use the `app` configuration value in the `ðŸŽ›.yaml` manifest file.

```file-name
/ðŸŽ›.yaml
```

```yaml
name: GreatApp

app: true
```

# Properties

Progressive web apps require various properties to enable home screen icons, startup screens, etc.

These [special variables](/ðŸ—„/Article/settings/properties.md#special) are defined in the `ðŸŽ¨.scss` properties file.  

Required values are: `$name`, `$short-name`, `$theme-color`, `$background-color`, `$icon-sm`, `$icon-lg`, `$icon-apple`.

For more information about each variable see the [properties file](/ðŸ—„/Article/settings/properties.md#special) doc.

# Use

Progressive web apps require configuration values in the document `<head>`.
Stacklane automatically assembles these values, as well as the "[Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)".

Simply include the following line in your Mustache file's `<head>`, usually in a layout template:

```file-name
/_layout.html
```

```html
<!--TEMPLATE mustache-->
<html>
<head>
... 
{{{ðŸŽ¨.WebApp}}}
...
{{$head}}Endpoint Specific Head{{/head}
</head>
...
```

## iOS

Legacy support for iOS does not have the "[Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)" recommendation.

Therefore we recommend only emitting Apple specific information on one HTML endpoint -- this being the specific endpoint
which a user is expected to choose "Add to Home Screen" from.

To explicitly emit Apple related tags, and assuming a layout template as in the example above:

```file-name
/index.html
```

```html
<!--TEMPLATE mustache-->
{{% partial /_layout }}
{{< layout}}

{{$head}}
{{{ðŸŽ¨.AppleMobile}}}
{{/head}}

....
```

The end result being that (between the layout template and endpoint template)
both `{{{ðŸŽ¨.WebApp}}}` and `{{{ðŸŽ¨.AppleMobile}}}` will be generated.

# Caching

App-enabled Stacklane sites automatically generate and install a service worker.
This service worker sets up 
pre-caching of static assets, 
dynamic caching of [model images](/ðŸ—„/Article/fields/image.md) ,
and custom caching for HTML endpoints.

## Third Party JavaScript

To ensure that third party JavaScript may be cached by the service worker,
specify `crossorigin="anonymous"`:

```html
<script src="https://...js" integrity="..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## Custom Caching Strategies

Individual HTML endpoints may be given custom caching strategies.
We recommend using these sparingly on only the most commonly accessed views.

- **Network-First (Network Falling Back to Cache)** --
  Good for endpoints which may be updated frequently. 
  By default it will try and fetch the latest request from the network. 
  If the request is successful, itâ€™ll put the response in the cache. 
  If the network fails to return a response, the caches response will be used.
- **Stale-While-Revalidate** --
  The stale-while-revalidate pattern responds to a request as
  quickly as possible with a cached response if available, falling back to the network 
  request if itâ€™s not cached. The network request is then used to update the cache.
  This is a fairly common strategy where having the most up-to-date resource is not vital to the application.

Specify the strategy as a Mustache pragma:

```html
<!--TEMPLATE mustache-->
{{% Network-First }}
...
```
