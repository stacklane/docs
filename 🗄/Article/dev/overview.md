title: Development Overview
summary: Learn the basics of Stacklane development.
---

Stacklane doesn't require any special UI setup to start coding -- everything
needed to run a Stacklane site is in familiar file formats,
ultimately hosted in a [GIT repository](/ðŸ—„/Article/dev/repositories.md).

# Quick Start {#start}

The quickest way to get started is by downloading the free
[IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) IDE.

After installation, install the Stacklane plugin by visiting
Preferences â†’ Plugins â†’ Marketplace.  Search for "Stacklane" and then install the plugin.

After restarting IntelliJ use the "Create New Project" dialog.
On the left side you'll be presented with various new project templates,
including one for "Stacklane". Follow the prompts to finish creating the project.

Once the Stacklane project is created, you'll be able to run it using the "Run" menu, or the green play button.

Where to go from here?  We recommend [checking out our examples](/examples).
