summary: Learn about setting up the email module.
---

The email module allows you to compose and send email using specific providers.
Pre-configured providers allow Stacklane to provide simpler configurations,
region specific endpoints, and automatic batching when applicable.
Contact us if you require a provider not already listed below.

# Basic Use {#basic}

Once configured, the email module named "📧" is available to non-GET JavaScript endpoints.

```file-name
/POST.js
```
```javascript
import {Email} from '📧';

Email.to('me@example.com')
     .subject('Hello')
     .text('World')
     .send();
```

If an exception occurs in the endpoint anywhere after `send()` being called,
the email send operation is automatically rolled back.

# Plain Text {#text}

For creating emails with longer plain text,
use a [Function Supplier](/🗄/Article/scripting/suppliers.md) combined with JavaScript template literals:

```file-name
/{account}/📤/{}BillingSetupEmailText.js
```
```javascript
let BillingSetupEmailText = (name)=>{

return `Dear ${name},

Thanks for setting up billing!`;

};

export {BillingSetupEmailText};
```

```file-name
/{account}/billing/POST.js
```
```javascript
import {Email} from '📧';
import {BillingSetupEmailText} from '📤';
import {account} from '🔗';
import * as Props from '🎨';

Email.to(account.billingEmail)
     .subject(Props.BillingSetupFinished())
     .text(BillingSetupEmailText(
       account.billingName
     ))
     .send();

Redirect.home().success(
  Props.BillingSetupFinished()
);
```

# Configuration

An email service provider must be configured with a username, password, and "from" address.
For sites configured in the Stacklane Console, the UI will guide the setup of these required fields.
For a test environment such as WebStorm, you'll need to configure these directly:

```javascript
{
  "🔑":{
    "email:[PROVIDER_TYPE]":{
      "user":"username",
      "pass":"password",
      "from":"from@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

- `"from"` &mdash; May either be a simple email address, or it may contain a display name
using the RFC822 format: `"Example & Co." <from@example.com>`
- `[PROVIDER_TYPE]` &mdash; Should be replaced with one of the supported provider types listed below.
For example the full key for Amazon SES would be `email:ses`.

# Providers

The following providers are currently supported.
To configure a provider from a test environment make sure and use its `type`.

## Google Gmail

- `type`: `gmail`

## Amazon SES

- `type`: `ses-us-east-1` / `ses-eu-west-1`, according to the AWS region the credentials have been setup in.

## Mailgun

- `type`: `mailgun`
