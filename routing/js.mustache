        <p>
            Stacklane uses a JavaScript <b>subset</b> for server-side logic.
            This subset is designed for speed, security, and compile time validation.
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript endpoints live at files named after HTTP verbs:
            <code>GET.js</code>, <code>POST.js</code>, <code>PUT.js</code>, <code>DELETE.js</code>.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="output">Output</a></h2>

        <p>
            Scripts are executed on the server-side only, and their last emitted value
            becomes the response value. Scripts do not produce HTML, which is better suited
            for <a href="/routing/mustache">Mustache</a> files.
            The following types of output are supported:
        </p>

        <h3>Redirects</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Internal redirects -
                    Output a string prefixed with "/"
                    to perform an absolute redirect to another endpoint within your app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    External redirects -
                    Output a string prefixed with "http" to perform an external redirect.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Rerouting</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to an internal redirect, but no extra client request is made.
            A few conditions must exist for this to occur.

            <ul>
                <li>It must be an POST/PUT/DELETE request.</li>
                <li>"X-Requested-With" header must exist and equal "XMLHttpRequest" (denoting an AJAX request).</li>
                <li>The script must emit an absolute path for the app, similar to an regular internal redirect.</li>
            </ul>

            For example, with a POST via AJAX returning '/show/all', the server would
            internally route and return the result of executing GET /show/all, <b>instead of</b>
            requiring the client to round trip as it would with a normal internal redirect.
        </p>

        <h3>JSON</h3>
        <p>
            Output an object literal from the script to create a JSON response.  For example:

            <pre><code>
({
  hello: 'world'
})
            </code></pre>

            Result:

            <pre><code>
{
  "hello": "world"
}
            </code></pre>

            Stream aware model methods may also be used:

            <pre><code>
/* Code to assign LoadedList variable */

({
  list: LoadedList.name,
  tasks: LoadedList(()=>Task.all().map(t=>({name:t.title}}))
})
            </code></pre>

            Result:

            <pre><code>
{
  "list": "hello"
  "tasks": [{"name":"world"}]
}
            </code></pre>
        </p>
