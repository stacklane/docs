        <p>
            Stacklane's limits are designed to guide and emphasize
            best practices in using the platform, not make your life difficult.
            In fact we hope you never encounter these limits.
            For every limit there is usually an alternative approach
            with better long term scale and maintenance characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, we limit the size of a repository to emphasize
            its use as controller + view, and not for example as a way
            to serve large files, or model-like content.
            Lists of embedded entries are limited to emphasize
            using containers for cases
            that may call for unbounded entries.  And so on.
        </p>
