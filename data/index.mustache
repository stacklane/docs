            Models represent structured data. Model <a href="/data/types">types</a> describe the overarching
            use case for the data, and the system determines the best underlying way to carry out that use case.
            Model types have defining characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages,
            that facilitate choosing one over the other.

            Modeling best practices follow those of document based databases, such as MongoDB.
            Document based modeling usually calls for much more denormalization than relational databases.
            For example, the classic Order/OrderItem two table relationship, would likely be come a single
            Order document with nested/embedded OrderItems.
            In a document based world there is no joining or foreign keys, only documents (Models) of a given type.
