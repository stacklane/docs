            <strong>Welcome to Stacklane</b></strong>

            Stacklane is the automatically scalable platform for smart microservices,
            data, and the restful web. No servers, no databases, no build configuration.
            A perfect stack of building blocks working in harmony for frictionless execution of ideas.

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>

        <p>
            Stacklane wants to stay out of your way, letting you get from idea to execution
            as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than a polyglot platform which has no preference on what languages, libraries,
            or infrastructure you use,
            we <i>do</i> have a preference --
            well known and time tested technologies which we then optimize
            specifically for the least amount of friction, setup, or compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want your learning curve to be low, and results to be direct and obvious.  Wherever
            possible we avoid creating a new API, and instead favor conventions over configuration.
            You'll see this everywhere from how files/folders are named, to the code in JavaScript endpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've been making technology choices and building web software for 20 years.
            There are mistakes we've made along the way, hard lessons learned, and choices we've had
            to live with years into a startup.  The advent of cloud computing has changed the game --
            but it has drastically increased the stack options available.
            The Stacklane platform distills decades of experience into essential and primary patterns,
            while abstracting best-in-class cloud infrastructure completely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stacklane wants your sole focus to be on purpose and outcome.  Infrastructure is always
            changing and your code should not have to change with it.
            We are constantly evaluating new offerings from cloud providers for incorporation
            into the Stacklane's offering.
