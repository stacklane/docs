            <strong>Welcome to Stacklane</b></strong>

            Stacklane is the automatically scalable platform for smart microservices,
            data, and the restful web. No servers, no databases, no build configuration.
            A perfect stack of building blocks working in harmony for frictionless execution of ideas.

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>

        <p>
            Stacklane wants to stay out of your way, letting you get from idea to execution
            as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than a polyglot platform which has no preference on what languages, libraries,
            or infrastructure you use,
            we <i>do</i> have a preference --
            well known and time tested technologies which we then optimize
            specifically for the least amount of friction, setup, or compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want your learning curve to be low, and results to be direct and obvious.  Wherever
            possible we avoid creating a new API, and instead favor conventions over configuration.
            You'll see this everywhere from how files/folders are named, to the code in JavaScript endpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stacklane wants your sole focus to be on purpose and outcome.  Infrastructure is always
            changing and your code should not have to change with it.  We choose best in class
            cloud services to power your websites, and are constantly evaluating the latest and greatest from
            Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
