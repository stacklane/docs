    <section>
        <h2><a name="default">Default</a></h2>
        <p>
            Every type is pre-defined with <code>created</code> and <code>modified</code> timestamp fields.
            These are automatically managed.

    <section>
        <h2><a name="default">Speciality</a></h2>

        <p>
            Speciality fields provide validation, and often lower provisioned sizes.
        </p>

        <h3><code>country</code></h3>

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3" target="_blank">ISO 3166-1 alpha-3</a>
            country code.

        </p>

        <h3><code>text</code></h3>
        <p>
            Limited and validated HTML "rich text".
            <br>

            <code>h1-h6</code>,
            <code>p</code>,

        </p>

        <h3><code>title</code></h3>
        <p>
            Special kind of <code>text</code> which is limited to a

            <br>

        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="embedded">Embedded</a></h2>

        <p>
            This is the field type corresponding to a complex value defined by an
            <a href="/models/types#embedded">Embedded</a> model type.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be a many valued array/list, in which case there is a limit of <b>20</b>
            embedded entries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provisioned size: sum of provisioned field sizes * times number of possible entries.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="unique">Unique Values</a></h2>

        <p>
            The <i>String</i> field type may be marked as unique for the <a href="/models/types#universal">Universal</a>
            model type only.  Unique values are constrained/scoped to the nearest <a href="/models/#containers">container</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deleting/removing a document will delete all associated unique values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Warning: Commits will fail / throw an exception if there is a unique value violation.
            Therefore it's highly recommended that if a unique value is being created or changing,
            that there exists logic to check whether the unique value is available.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="uid">URL Identifiers (UID)</a></h2>

        <p>
            <code>uid</code> is used for "user friendly" unique identifiers destined for URL paths (aka URL slugs).
        </p>
        <p>
            This field is always unique, and is available for the <a href="/models/types#universal">Universal</a>
            and <a href="/models/types#universal">Content</a> type's.
        </p>
        <p>
            To keep URLs formatted according to best practices, it must start and end with
            any character a-z, A-Z, or 0-9.  Between the start and end, dash characters are also allowed.
            Minimum length is 2 characters.  Maximum length is 100 characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> UID's behave differently than other unique values.  Because they are destined
            for URLs, it's implied that when modified the previous value is not lost
            (otherwise any previously published URL would result in a broken link).
            Therefore a single model field may have multiple unique UID values associated with it,
            however at any given time only one is "current" or "primary".
        </p>
        <p>
            In an ideal scenario from an SEO standpoint, if the visitor has reached a URL by an older UID,
            then it's recommended you redirect to the current/primary UID value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provisioned size: 100 bytes.
