        <p>
            With Stacklane you never have to worry about indexes, sharding, or scaling.
            The platform provisions automatically based on the model types chosen
            and the access patterns expected of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Models represent structured data. Model <a href="/models/types">types</a> describe the overarching
            use case for the data, and the system determines the best underlying way to carry out that use case.
            Model types have defining characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages,
            that facilitate choosing one over the other.  Learn more about each below.

        <h2>Denormalized Documents</h2>
        <p>
            Modeling best practices follow those of document based databases, such as MongoDB.
            Document based modeling usually calls for much more denormalization than relational databases.
            For example, the classic Order/OrderItem two table relationship, would likely become a single
            Order document with nested/embedded OrderItems.
            In a document based world there is no joining or foreign keys, only documents (Models) of a given type.

        <h2>Designing with Containers</h2>
        <p>
            A key concept in Stacklane is the "container", which creates a strong one-to-many,
            or parent/child relationship.

            A container may have many kinds of children,
            but a child may only have one kind of container/parent.
            For example, "Account/X" and "Account/Y", but there would
            never be another parent for "X" besides "Account".
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Containers</h3>
        <p>
            Containers may be deeply nested, such as Account ▶ Site ▶ Order, or User ▶ List ▶ Task.
            However in these examples, there are two kinds of containers.
            It's recommended that the top level models in these examples (Account and User)
            be defined as the <a href="/models/types#tenant">Tenant</a> type.
            Where Site and List are simply <a href="/models/types#universal">Universal</a> containers.
        </p>

        <h3>Behavior of Unique Values</h3>

        <p>
            If a model type within a container defines unique values, then those
            unique values are local/specific to a given container.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, given Blog ▶ Post, where Post has a <a href="/models/fields#uid">UID</a> field named "slug".
            If there are many Blog's, and many Posts within any given Blog, then the two Posts may have
            same UID if they are in <b>separate</b> Blog's.
        </p>
