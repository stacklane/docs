    <p>
        With Stacklane you never have to worry about indexes, sharding, or scaling.
        The platform provisions automatically based on the model types chosen
        and the access patterns expected of them.

    <p>
        Models represent structured data. Model <a href="/models/types">types</a> describe the overarching
        use case for the data, and the system determines the best underlying way to carry out that use case.
        Model types have defining characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages,
        that facilitate choosing one over the other.  Learn more about each below.

            The Event type orders by its `created` timestamp, descending from newest to oldest.
            This type is for events, time-series data, activity, or logging.
            Events accumulate over time at a potentially high frequency/volume.
