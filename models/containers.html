        <p>
            A key concept in Stacklane is the "container", which creates a strong one-to-many,
            or parent/child relationship. A container may have many kinds of children,
            but a child may only have one kind of container/parent.
            For example, "Account/X" and "Account/Y", but there would
            never be another parent for "X" besides "Account".

        <h2>Types of Containers</h2>
        <p>
            Containers may be deeply nested, such as Account ▶ Site ▶ Order, or Project ▶ List ▶ Task.
            However in these examples, there are two kinds of containers.
            It's recommended that the top level models in these examples (Account and Project)
            be defined as the <a href="/models/types#tenant">Tenant</a> type.
            Where Site and List are simply <a href="/models/types#universal">Universal</a> containers.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Access Control</h2>
        <p>
            Containers are an important access control point.
            By placing a <a href="/model/types#profile">User Profile</a> type within a container type
            such as <a href="/model/types#tenant">Tenant</a>,
            the profile may be assigned <a href="/settings/users#groups">groups</a> specific
            to a user of that container.
            This behavior works automatically when containers are used as a dynamic path parameter.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Behavior of Unique Values</h2>

        <p>
            If a model type within a container defines unique values, then those
            unique values are local/specific to a given container.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, given Blog ▶ Post, where Post has a <a href="/models/fields#uid">UID</a> field named "slug".
            If there are many Blog's, and many Posts within any given Blog, then the two Posts may have
            same UID if they are in <b>separate</b> Blog's.
        </p>
