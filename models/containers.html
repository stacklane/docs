        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Containers in Stacklane are an important modeling concept.
            They creates a strong one-to-many,
            or parent/child relationship.
            A container may have many kinds of children,
            but a child may only have one kind of container/parent.
            For example, "Account/X" and "Account/Y", but there would
            never be another parent for "X" besides "Account".
            The container (parent) is always a <a href="/model/types#universal">Universal</a> type.
        </p>

        <h2>Access Control</h2>
        <p>
            Containers are an important access control point.
            Any roles specifically associated between a user and a container
            will be in effect for the container and its descendants.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Behavior of Unique Values</h2>

        <p>
            If a model type within a container defines unique values, then those
            unique values are local/specific to a given container.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, given Blog â–¶ Post, where Post has a <a href="/models/fields#uid">UID</a> field named "slug".
            If there are many Blog's, and many Posts within any given Blog, then two Posts may have
            same UID if they are in <b>separate</b> Blog's.
