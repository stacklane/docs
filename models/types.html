        <h1>Model Types</h1>

        <p>
           Learn about model types, and how to choose the best for the job.
        </p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="universal">Universal</a></h2>

        <p>
            This is a general purpose type, suitable for a wide range of entities and concepts.
            It supports unique values, and may be a singleton.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Universal type may optionally be a <a href="/models/containers">container</a> for other types.
            For example, a <i>List</i> might be defined as a container
            for <i>Task</i>'s.
        </p>

        <p>
            While this type has broad cases, review the other model types before choosing it,
            to ensure that another type is not more suitable. It should not be
            used for extremely unbounded data, such as <i>Orders</i> or <i>Comments</i>
            (better suited for the Event type).  It does not allow large text fields,
            and is therefore not suitable for an article, blog post, or product description.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="tenant">Tenant</a></h2>

        <p>
            Use for top level <a href="/models/containers">containers</a> where there is a clear case to silo or
            strongly isolate all of the descendant data models.
            "Account", "Project", etc -- any top level container whose data is highly specific to it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Keep in mind that due to their narrow purpose, Tenant's are highly limited compared to other types.
            You may only create or update <b>1</b> Tenant in a single request.
            They can only be retrieved by a field defined as unique, or their ID.
        </p>

        <h3>Query Considerations</h3>
        <p>
            A Tenant container starts a new "query isolation" scope.
            Given the example hierarchy Account ▶︎ List ▶︎ Task, and a query for <code>Task.name('something')</code>,
            the scope of Tasks that will be queried varies depending on which of the two possible
            ancestor containers are selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the <code>Task.name('something')</code> query is executed in the scope of the User, then all Tasks across
            all Lists by that single Account will be queried by name.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the <code>Task.name('something')</code> query is executed in the scope of a List, then only Tasks within
            the single List will be queried by name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because query isolation is in effect starting at a single User,
            it is not possible to search for all Tasks's across all User's.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="event">Event</a></h2>

        <p>
            This type is for events, time-series data, activity, or logging.
            Events accumulate (in a healthy business), as time goes by, at a potentially high frequency/volume.
            Events are not "crafted" or "authored" -- they "occur".
        </p>
        <p>
            Orders, comments, and Twitter posts are considered "events", from the standpoint of their
            potentially high frequency, their small size, and their permanence/low-mutability.
            Once created they are usually not modified again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another distinguishing characteristic is that newer Events are generally more relevant than older events,
            with very old Events having little to no relevance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Events have a "useful time horizon" for queries, of either yearly, monthly, or daily.
            The default of one year should be suitable for most cases, and is easiest to develop against.
            A query for events may only span two time partitions.  So in the case of the default
            yearly horizon, a single query could span two years.
        </p>

        <h3>Query Scope</h3>
        <p>
            The Event type is always isolated to its immediate parent container for query scope.
            Given Account ▶︎ Site ▶︎ Orders, the Orders Event type must always be queried in the context of a single Site.
            In other words, you must first know the Site you want to query before you query for Orders.
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Designed for highest write volume.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Automatic partitioning over time. There is no "performance penalty" to a business that has
                    events growing over time, where newer events are generally more relevant than previous events.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unique values are not allowed.</li>
                <li>Must always exist within a Tenant or container.</li>
                <li>All queries must include date/time range (it is not possible to query for all Events).</li>
                <li><a href="#embedded">Embedded</a> models must be "local" to the Event type --
                    thereby enforcing they are "purpose built" for that Event type.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="content">Content</a></h2>
        <p>
            Roadmap.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="profile">User Profile</a></h2>
        <p>
            User profiles are only relevant and available
            when <a href="/settings/users">user related</a> functionality is enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            User profiles are always associated with a single user.
            They may either be container-less, in which case they are represented as a singleton.
            Or they may be contained by a <a href="#tenant">Tenant</a>.
            You may only create or update <b>1</b> user profile in a single request.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="embedded">Embedded</a></h2>

        <p>
            Embedded models create a complex value (or sub-document) that can be used as a field type for another model type.
            It may also be used for lists, where for example "Order.items" is a list of "OrderItem" embedded values.
            Models to be embedded take on the field limitations of whatever type they are embedded on.
        </p>

        <h3>Local vs. Global</h3>
        <p>
            Global Embedded types may be used and embedded within any other type,
            as long as their fields are compatible with that type.
            They have a distinct name and configuration file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Local Embedded types may only be used and embedded within a single model type,
            and they are defined directly in the same model configuration file that uses them.
