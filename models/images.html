        <p>
            The <code>image</code> field type stores a single image. Supported image types are JPG, GIF, PNG.
            Because non-expert users may be using your site/app, the system supports image uploads of up to {{ðŸŽ¨.image-max-upload}}.
            However all images will be re-sized to be no more than {{ðŸŽ¨.image-resize-width}} wide (with a proportional height).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="display">Displaying</a></h2>

        <p>
            Images are served out of an optimized, secure, and "generic" domain name
            which is independent from the domain your site is hosted on.
            The image URLs are not designed to be user friendly or directly shared.
            Image URLs should always be embedded in HTML, even if it's a simple
            shareable "wrapper".
        </p>

        <p>
            Using a Mustache template, simply embed the URL:
        <p>
        <pre class="language-html"><code>
&lt;img src="&#123;&#123;Post.image.url&#125;&#125;" width="1000"&gt;
    </code></pre>
        </p>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="sharing">Friendly URLs</a></h2>
        <p>
            Image URLs alone are not designed to be user friendly.
            The are long, located on a generic domain, may expire, and contain unique identifiers.
            For these reasons, if you need to share a friendly image URL we do not
            recommend giving out image URLs directly.
        </p>

        <h3>Using a Dedicated HTML Page</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of giving out an image that displays an image directly,
            we recommend "wrapping" it in an HTML endpoint.
            This gives you more flexibility in the future for what is
            displayed "around" the image, provides analytics opportunities, etc.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="access">Access Control</a></h2>

        <p>
            By default all images are served using a temporary private URL.
            These private URLs are only served over HTTPS and expire in 1 hour.
            This ensures that images follow the same access controls as the model's field it is associated with.
            For example, if you're serving images from within a private membership area,
            then the temporary image URLs will not live past a typical login session.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you know that images will primarily be used from publicly accessible pages,
            such as within the posts of a public CMS, then there is a per-field optimization
            to use public URLs:
        </p>

        <p>
        <pre class="language-yaml"><code>
coverImage:
  type: image
  public: true
    </code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            This public setting causes the image URL to be non-expiring,
            and uses a "public" Cache-Control header with a much longer "max-age".
        </p>

        <p>
            If you start out with a private image field (the default) and then sometime later
            add <code>public: true</code>, then this setting will only take effect for newly uploaded images
            from that point forward. The opposite is true if going from public to private.
        </p>
    </section>

        <h2><a name="uploading">Uploading</a></h2>

        <p>
            Uploading images from the browser to a model field is done in three overall steps.
            It's important to think of uploading images as <i>independent</i> from
            updating a model's data. Images previously uploaded
            are not "committed" unless they are associated with a model's field (described below).
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>:
            Obtain a one-time-use URL that will be the destination of the PUT.
            This is typically done with XHR that accesses a simple JavaScript endpoint such as:
        </p>

        <p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>
import {Post} from 'ðŸ“¦';
import {name} from 'form';

if (!Post.image.isValidFileName(name)) throw 'InvalidImageFileName';
let newUrl = Post.image.newPutUrl(name);

({url: newUrl});
    </code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>:
            Use XHR to PUT the file data to the one-time-use URL retrieved in the first step.
            This can be complex on the client side, and we recommend taking a look
            at our <a href="https://github.com/stacklane-examples/image-upload" target="_blank">example</a>.
            The browser's file input accept attribute should be:
            <code>.png, .jpg, .gif, image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif</code>
            Specifying both extensions and mime types is recommended by the spec.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>:
            After a successful upload in step two,
            the one-time-use URL obtained from the first step is used for the model's
            field data:
        </p>

        <p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>
import {Post} from 'ðŸ“¦';
import {image} from 'form';

let post = new Post().image(image);

({id: post.id});
    </code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            It's important to note that on the third and final step,
            there is no need to send multipart/form-data, or it
            should be stripped out before the third step.
            The image's binary data was already sent in Step 2.
            (Our <a href="https://github.com/stacklane-examples/image-upload" target="_blank">example</a>
             takes care of that for you).
        </p>

        <h3>Working Example</h3>

        <p>
            The steps above are relatively boilerplate, especially step two.
            We've put together a full <a href="https://github.com/stacklane-examples/image-upload" target="_blank">example</a>
            that we recommend looking at.
            This examples includes a StimulusJS widget, that with a few modifications
            could be useful in any project.
