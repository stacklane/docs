        <h1>Endpoint Basics</h1>

        <p>
           Learn how to structure files and folders into REST endpoints and views.
        </p>

    <section>
        <p>
        Files and folders in your source code closely match the
        resulting RESTful paths and endpoints.
        </p>

        <p>
        The main types of files supported include
        <a href="/endpoints/js">JavaScript</a>,
        <a href="/endpoints/mustache">Mustache</a>,
        and
        <a href="/endpoints/assets">SASS/SCSS</a>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="dynamic">Dynamic Path Parameters</a></h2>

        <p>
            Placeholders may be used in a path node.

            For example:

            <code>/article/{article}/index.html</code>

            would be served at the HTML endpoint

            <code>/article/1234</code>

            (other logic determines whether "1234" is a valid article or not).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="private">Private Files</a></h2>

        <p>
            Any file prefixed with an underscore <code>_fileName.html</code>
            will never be publicly accessible, and is only used for
            server side includes or similar logic (for example SASS or Mustache partial).
        </p>

        <p>
            Similarly any files whose <b>direct</b> parent folder
            has an underscore such as <code>/_files/something.html</code>,
            will be considered private even if the files themselves are not prefixed
            with an underscore.
        </p>
