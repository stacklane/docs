            Learn how to use SASS/SCSS, CSS, static HTML, and client side JS.

    <section>
        <h2><a name="sass">SASS/SCSS</a></h2>

        <p>
            Stacklane includes native support for <code>.scss</code> files.
            If you have a SCSS file at <code>/theme.scss</code>, then reference this
            in your HTML or Mustache file as you would any CSS file:

        <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/theme.scss&quot; ... &gt;
            </code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            We recommend using SCSS over plain CSS as it inherently supports
            combining many files into one, as well as minification.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="html">HTML</a></h2>

        <p>
            If you do not need the extra capabilities of <a href="/endpoints/mustache">Mustache</a>
            templates, then a plain HTML file may be used.  It follows the same routing conventions
            and <a href="/endpoints/mustache#csp">CSP</a> requirements as Mustache files,
            including putting <code>index.html</code> into a route with a
            trailing slash. Therefore if you decide to rename your file extension to use Mustache
            in the future, there is no change to the public endpoint/URL.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="css">CSS</a></h2>

        <p>
            You can include a <code>.css</code> anywhere,
            however in general we recommend SASS/SCSS (<code>.scss</code>) files
            due to the additional capabilities offered.
            There are performance benefits to SCSS in addition to its functionality --
            SCSS inherently supports combining many files into one, as well
            as minification.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="js">Third Party JS</a></h2>

        <p>
            We like to think of third party JS libraries as part of the browser's stack
            -- something that extends the native functionality of the browser, and that your
            app can put to use.

            We generally do not recommend hosting these
            along with your other Stacklane files,
            as it brings no benefit.

            There are many excellent content delivery networks these days, where
            third party libraries are dependable, static, and versioned.

            <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsDelivr</a> is one such service,
            which supports combining several files, among other features.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2><a name="custom_js">Custom JS</a></h2>

        <p>
            Unless you're building Angular-style single page applications, then
            we recommend keeping your client-side JavaScript to a minimum.
            Whenever possible consider using native
            <a target="_blank"  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element">DOM</a>
            methods, or the tongue-in-cheek <a target="_blank" href="http://vanilla-js.com/">VanillaJS</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Inlining</h3>
        <p>
            Provided any major functionality has been brought in via a third party JS library,
            in many cases it may make sense to simply inline your JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inline in the normal way using <code>&lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively you may inline a <a href="/endpoints/#private">private</a> file by
            referencing it like any external script:
            <code>&lt;script src="/_myCode.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.
            Because of the underscore marking it as a private file,
            Stacklane inlines the JS into the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            In either case Stacklane produces an appropriate <a href="/infrastructure#csp">CSP</a>.
        </p>
